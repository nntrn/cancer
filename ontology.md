# Primitive Ontology 

Each primitive functions as an abstract structural rule that governs how biological systems behave when they become cancerous.

### PRIMITIVE 1: Generativity

    Definition:
    A system state in which new configurations can be produced without requiring external instruction, constraint, or direction

    Properties: 
    * Produces unlimited variants over time
    * Not bounded by past states; always able to exceed existing patterns
    * Can operate at any biological scale (cell, tissue, organ, systemic)

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains heterogeneity, evolution, adaptation, resistance, metastasis, relapse, and recurrence

### PRIMITIVE 2: Openness

    Definition:
    A condition where regulatory cycles fail to return to closure, allowing generative processes to continue indefinitely

    Properties:
    * Means not fully: resolved, terminated, or restored to baseline
    * Allows persistence of latent or dormant states
    * Enables reactivation after apparent elimination

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains dormancy, relapse unpredictability, multi-site recurrence, long latency, and minimal residual disease

### PRIMITIVE 3: Closure

    Definition:
    A state in which generativity is terminated or neutralized by internal or external constraints

    Properties:
    * Restores equilibrium
    * Prevents further variation
    * Necessary condition for cure or stable quiescence

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains why cure requires more than cell killing; it requires the structural closure of all generative loops

### PRIMITIVE 4: Fractality

    Definition:
    Generativity and openness occur recursively and simultaneously at multiple biological scales

    Properties:
    * Local and systemic processes mirror each other
    * Subclone evolution, tissue remodeling, metastasis, and immune escape follow similar structural patterns
    * Behavior at micro-level can reappear at macro-level

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains microenvironmental complexity, metastatic spread, multi-level resistance, and systemic symptoms

### PRIMITIVE 5: Parity Asymmetry

    Definition:
    Systems with "even closure" behave predictably and resolve; systems with "odd, unpaired" states remain generative

    Properties:
    * Even = closed, paired, terminating
    * Odd = unpaired, continuing, self-propagating
    * Cancer is structurally an odd-state phenomenon (unclosed cycles)

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains why cancer behaves irregularly, why it resists stabilization, and why treatments often fail to terminate it

### PRIMITIVE 6: Paused Generativity

    Definition:
    A dormant but unclosed generative cycle

    Properties:
    * Not active, not gone
    * Can reactivate without warning
    * Behaves differently from complete closure

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains dormancy, minimal residual disease, and late relapse

### PRIMITIVE 7: Selection Under Constraint

    Definition:
    Generative processes adapt in response to external pressure rather than stopping

    Properties:
    * Pressure accelerates variation
    * Eliminating one trajectory produces alternative ones
    * Resistance is structurally guaranteed unless cycles close

    Relevance to cancer:
    Explains therapy resistance, cross-resistance, convergent evolution, and escape mutations

## Parity Model Schema

Mapping each cancer behavior to primitive structure

---

### A. INITIATION

1. Transformation of normal cell to cancer cell  
    **Primitive:** [Openness] + [Parity Asymmetry]  
    **Reason:** When normal cycles fail to close, the system enters an unpaired generative state

2. Tissue-specific susceptibility  
    **Primitive:** [Openness]  
    **Reason:** Tissues in chronic open states (regeneration, inflammation) transform more easily

### B. GROWTH & PROGRESSION

3. Uncontrolled proliferation  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Proliferation is simply generativity without closure

4. Loss of growth control / contact inhibition  
    **Primitive:** [Openness]  
    **Reason:** Spatial and signaling closure no longer occurs

5. Genomic instability  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity] + [Parity Asymmetry]  
    **Reason:** Error correction cycles are unpaired, leading to continuous variation

### C. HETEROGENEITY & EVOLUTION

6. Subclone diversity  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Open generative cycles continuously produce new variants

7. Parallel evolution  
    **Primitive:** [Fractality]  
    **Reason:** Multiple scales produce similar adaptation patterns

8. Unpredictable shifts in tumor composition  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Open systems cannot be exhaustively predicted

### D. DORMANCY & LATENCY

9. Long-term dormancy  
    **Primitive:** [Paused Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Cycles are not closed; they are held

10. Sudden relapse after years  
    **Primitive:** [Openness]  
    **Reason:** An unclosed system can restart at any moment

### E. RESISTANCE & ADAPTATION

11. Rapid emergence of drug resistance  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Resistance is produced structurally as a new generative output

12. Cross-resistance  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity] + [Fractality]  
    **Reason:** Multi-scale adaptation occurs in parallel

13. Resistance pre-existing before therapy  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Variation precedes selection in open systems

### F. METASTASIS & SPREAD

14. Ability to colonize distant organs  
    **Primitive:** [Fractality]  
    **Reason:** [Generativity] extends across spatial scale

15. Organ-specific "seed and soil" patterns  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Sufficient variant diversity ensures compatibility in some sites

### G. RECURRENCE & RELAPSE

16. Local or distant recurrence  
    **Primitive:** [Openness] + [Fractality]  
    **Reason:** Open cycles exist at multiple sites

17. More aggressive relapse  
    **Primitive:** Selection Under [Constraint]  
    **Reason:** Post-therapy cycles generate stronger variants

### H. SYSTEMIC EFFECTS

18. Cachexia, systemic inflammation  
    **Primitive:** [Fractality]  
    **Reason:** Generative disruption propagates to whole-body regulation

19. Paraneoplastic syndromes  
    **Primitive:** [Generativity]  
    **Reason:** Novel systemic signals emerge from generative cycles

### I. ERADICATION FAILURE

20. Impossible to cure metastatic disease  
    **Primitive:** [Fractality] + [Openness]  
    **Reason:** Too many distributed open cycles for closure

21. Cure only when all cycles closed  
    **Primitive:** [Closure]  
    **Reason:** Eradication is a structural act, not just a quantitative one

### J. SUCCESSFUL CURE

22. Stability and non-recurrence  
    **Primitive:** [Closure]  
    **Reason:** All generative potentials are terminated
